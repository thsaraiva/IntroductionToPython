#### Program Outline

- Time your program - Done!✅
    - Use Time Module to compute program runtime
- Get program Inputs from the user - Done!✅
    - Use command line arguments to get user inputs
- Create Pet Images Labels - Done!✅
    - Use the pet images filenames to create labels
    - Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
- Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels - Done!✅
    - Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
    - Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
    - Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
- Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
    - Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
    - Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
- Calculate the Results
    - Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
- Print the Results

- Repeat these tasks for each of the three image classification algorithms that are provided to you.
